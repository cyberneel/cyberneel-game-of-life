            <div class="desc">&emsp;Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game that simulates the evolution of cells on a grid. Each cell can be either alive or dead, and its state depends on the number of live neighbors it has. The game follows four simple rules</div>
            <ol>
                <li>A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
                <br>
                <li>A live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
                <br>
                <li>A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
                <br>
                <li>A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="desc">The game was invented by British mathematician John Conway in 1970 and became widely known after it was featured in Scientific American. It is a fascinating example of cellular automata, complex systems, and emergent behavior.</div>
